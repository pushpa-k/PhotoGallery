## ToDo
1. Add swipe functionality i.e. onTouchStart, onTouchMove, onTouchEnd
2. Handle case when there are large no. of images. 
  - Lazy load images
  - Update translate so that clicking next on last image directly goes to the first image. Currently, clicking next on last image slides through all the images to get to the first one.
3. Use icons for arrow
